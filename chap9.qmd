# Week 9: Social media tracking and NLP

In past weeks, we've discussed the use of social media and digital trace data of different kinds.

This week, we'll be looking at the *active* tracking of social media as well as the use of more advanced techniques in the computational analysis of text.

To do so, we will look at examples from key substantive focuses of interest in last week: online information and misinformation.
