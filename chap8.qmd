# Week 8: Violence and protest

This week we will be studying the relationship between violence, protest, and the emergence of new Internet-enabled technologies and social media platforms. This has again been a headline claim in journalistic and other [reports](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/)

We will be turning to the scientific literature to examine the evidence and theoretical motivation for these claims.
