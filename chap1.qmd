# Week 1

This week will be dedicated to a more general introduction to computational social science and what it means to think "computationally."

In essence, this means getting used to different types of data. These might be:

-   Social media data;
-   Image data;
-   Sound data;
-   Video data;
-   Remote sensing data;
-   Call detail records

These data are "found" or "trace" data. They are not custom-made for social science; they *can* be repurposes, though, for answering questions in the social sciences.
