	abstract = {Science rarely proceeds beyond what scientists can observe and measure, and sometimes what can be observed proceeds far ahead of scientific understanding. The twenty-first century offers such a moment in the study of human societies. A vastly larger share of behaviours is observed today than would have been imaginable at the close of the twentieth century. Our interpersonal communication, our movements and many of our everyday actions, are all potentially accessible for scientific research; sometimes through purposive instrumentation for scientific objectives (for example, satellite imagery), but far more often these objectives are, literally, an afterthought (for example, Twitter data streams). Here we evaluate the potential of this massive instrumentation—the creation of techniques for the structured representation and quantification—of human behaviour through the lens of scientific measurement and its principles. In particular, we focus on the question of how we extract scientific meaning from data that often were not created for such purposes. These data present conceptual, computational and ethical challenges that require a rejuvenation of our scientific theories to keep up with the rapidly changing social realities and our capacities to capture them. We require, in other words, new approaches to manage, use and analyse data.},

          , 
            The field of computational social science (CSS) has exploded in prominence over the past decade, with thousands of papers published using observational data, experimental designs, and large-scale simulations that were once unfeasible or unavailable to researchers. These studies have greatly improved our understanding of important phenomena, ranging from social inequality to the spread of infectious diseases. The institutions supporting CSS in the academy have also grown substantially, as evidenced by the proliferation of conferences, workshops, and summer schools across the globe, across disciplines, and across sources of data. But the field has also fallen short in important ways. Many institutional structures around the field—including research ethics, pedagogy, and data infrastructure—are still nascent. We suggest opportunities to address these issues, especially in improving the alignment between the organization of the 20th-century university and the intellectual requirements of the field.},

First, it discusses two approaches for making computational methods accessible: showing the big picture and walking through the workflow. Second, a step-by-step guide for a typical course is provided using three examples: learning programming fundamentals, wrangling messy data, and communicating data analysis.},

	abstract = {In recent years, social scientists with data science skills have gained positions in academic and non-academic organizations as computational social scientists who blend skillsets from data science and social science. Yet as this trend is relatively new in the social sciences, navigating these emerging and diverse career paths remains ambiguous. We formalize this hidden curriculum by providing a step-by-step guide to graduate students based on our collective experiences as computational social scientists working in academic, public, and private sector organizations. Specifically, we break down the computational social science (CSS) professionalization process into three steps: (1) learning data science skills; (2) building a portfolio that focuses on using data science to answer social science questions; and (3) connecting with other computational social scientists. For each step, we identify and elaborate on core competencies and additional useful skills that are specific to the academic and non-academic job markets. Although this article is not exhaustive, it provides a much-needed guide for graduate students, as well as their faculty advisors and departments, to navigate the growing field of computational social science. By sharing this guide, we hope to help make computational social science professionalization more systematic and accessible.},
