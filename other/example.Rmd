## Question 1

In the following, I count the number of different types of `transType` in the web tracking data. I do this by grouping by the `transType` variable and using the function `count()`.

```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)

wbdata <- jsonlite::fromJSON(gzcon(url("https://github.com/cjbarrie/CS-ED/blob/main/data/web_historian_data.json?raw=true")))

wbdata_types <- wbdata %>% 
  group_by(transType) %>%
  count()
```
