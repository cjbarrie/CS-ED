# Computational Sociology {.unnumbered}

This is the course book we will be using for Computational Sociology (PGSP11583).

```{r}
print("Computational Sociology")
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
The book is a "live" document meaning I will be updating as we progress together through the course.
