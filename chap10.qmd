# Week 10: Guest lecture

This week, we will have a guest lecture on large language models and algorithmic justice.

Large language models are powering a lot of the recommendation and information retrieval systems you use everyday. But given that these models are built on human-produced text, they tend to recreate the bias and stereotyping that characterize our language.

The readings for this week provide an introduction to some of these issues, as well as how we might go about addressing them.
