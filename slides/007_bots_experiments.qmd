## Introduction

1.  Housekeeping
2.  Bots and Experiments

## Introduction: Experiments

Experiments versus surveys:

In experiments -- randomization into **treatment** not into the sample

## Introduction: Experiments

So how representative does it have to be...?

\--\> Depends on the question and *how* unrepresentative

\--\> Depends on whether we think likely to be treatment effect heterogeneity

## Introduction: Experiments

Treatment could be:

1.  Exposure to some information
2.  Encouragement to stop using social media
3.  Playing a game with an individual who votes for opposing political party

...and countless more

## Experiments and the Internet

1.  Online crowd work using online workers
2.  Online experiments with humans
3.  Online treatments using bots
4.  Machine-only experiments without any humans...

## Crowd workers

MTurk and Prolific (and others) provide:

1.  Constantly live pool of online workers for:
    1.  For labelling tasks

    2.  Survey tasks

    3.  Experiments

## Crowd workers

But are these representative...?

## Crowd workers

But do they need to be representative?

-   Remember: experimental research requires randomization into treatment not sample

    -   But how *un*representative can it be?

## Crowd workers

So how have these been used...?

1.  For data labeling
2.  As experimental samples for high-impact research

## Bots as treatment

Can code substitute for the *confederate*?

## A note on computational thinking

This week:

1.  Extending social theory to online world through use of platform affordances
2.  Auditing algorithmic influence by experimenting with algorithmic output itself--i.e., doing social science experiments without involving any human beings...
