## Why would social media promote protest?

Answers from the literature:

-   Information (@steinert-threlkeld2017 @bennett2013)

-   Coordination (@little2016)

-   Moralization (@mooijman2018)

## Why would social media promote protest?

Answers from the literature:

-   Information

    -   Information more readily available on extra-institutional forms of political behaviour

    -   Information more readily available on the activities of governments and other actors

-   Coordination

## Why would social media promote protest?

Answers from the literature:

-   Information

-   Coordination

    -   We can more easily--and horizontally--coordinate with fellow protestors *at once* and without need for physical proximity

    -   We can more easily *observe* what others are doing around us

-   Moralization

## Why would social media promote protest?

Answers from the literature:

-   Information

-   Coordination

-   Moralization

    -   Platform affordances mean moralizing rhetoric receives more engagement

## A note on computational thinking

This week:

1.  Using new media to derive proxies of coordination behaviour otherwise unmeasurable using traditional data sources
2.  Combining empirical documentary material with digital traces to understand the response to political repression
