## Social media tracking... why?

-   "always-on" means we can study phenomena otherwise hard to capture:

    -   protest

    -   culture

    -   radicalization

        -   many more... ideas?

## Social media tracking... why?

-   To provide a historical archive

    -   utterances online are consequentiall

        -   therefore need to be documented... see e.g. [LOC](https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2017/12/update-on-the-twitter-archive-at-the-library-of-congress-2/)

## Social media tracking... why?

-   To measure experimental outcomes

    -   we've seen how social media can be used as experimental platform

        -   and by tracking we can measure over-time changes (equivalent of follow-up)

## Social media tracking... how?

1.  After the event

2.  Live streaming (w/ API endpoint/scraping tool)

## Social media tracking... how?

1.  After the event

-   Using e.g., Twitter API

    -   Searching for keywords/users

-   Using e.g., Reddit data dumps

    -   Identifying users and posts

## Social media tracking... how?

2.  Live streaming (w/ API endpoint/scraping tool)

-   Using e.g., Twitter Streaming API (see [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/stream-tweets-in-real-time))

    -   Streaming in content according to parameters

-   Using e.g., TikTok scraper (see [here](https://pypi.org/project/TikTokLive/))

    -   Streaming in content outside of an API (ethical clearance!)

## ...but why is NLP relevant here?

Natural Language Processing refers to;

-   The computational restructuring, labelling, and analysis of text

## ...but why is NLP relevant here?

And most of these data come in the form of... text!

## So what can NLP help us do?

-   The construction of similarity scores

## So what can NLP help us do?

An example:

-   "We are all very happy to be at a lecture at 11AM" 

-   "We are all even happier that we don't have a lecture next week"

    -   How do these **compare**?

## Word-level

## Document-level

![](images/Screenshot%202022-11-14%20at%2018.38.58-01.png)

## Other measures...

1.  Euclidean distance  √∑(a - b)2 

2.  Manhattan (Block) distance ∑(a - b)

3.  Cosine similarity ∑(ab)/√(∑a2)(∑b2)

4.  Jaccard similarity (a∩b/a∪b) = \|a∩b\| / \|a\|+\|b\|−\|a∩b\|

## Back to conspiracy theories

## But it's not just similarity...

-   Sentiment

    -   Examples

-   Scaling

    -   Examples

-   Clustering

    -   Examples

-   Embedding

    -   Examples

## A note on computational thinking

This week:

1.  Using the "always-on" nature of digital data to document temporal dynamics
2.  Automating the understanding of language... Come to my other course!
