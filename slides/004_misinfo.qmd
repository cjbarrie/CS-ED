## Introduction

1.  Housekeeping
2.  Misinformation and fake news

## Introduction: Misinformation and fake news

-   When is the last time you read some misinfo. online?

## Introduction: Misinformation and fake news

-   Do you think others are more exposed than you?
    -   Why?

## Introduction: Misinformation and fake news

-   When is the last time you believed some misinformation/fake news online?

## Introduction: Misinformation and fake news

-   When is the last time you believed some misinformation/fake news online?
    -   Do you think it affected you?

        -   How?

## Why it matters

## Why it matters

## But what is it?

Often abused terms...

**Misinformation**: (un)knowingly false information

**Disinformation**: knowingly false information often spread to advance a particular cause or viewpoint

**Fake news**: knowingly false information often designed to look like real news

## Some examples

**Misinformation**: the claim that exiting the European Union would deliver Â£350m

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-10%20at%2014.16.37.png)](https://fullfact.org/europe/350-million-week-boris-johnson-statistics-authority-misuse/)

## Some examples

**Disinformation**: the claim that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a result of US treaty non-compliance and NATO aggression

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-10%20at%2016.36.04.png)](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-02-26/Why-would-Russia-want-to-develop-its-security-guarantees--17XSXiM8qm4/index.html)

## Some examples

**Fake news**: the claim that Ukraine is organizing nuclear strike on Russia

## So what questions should we be asking?

1.  Do we all get exposed to misinformation/fake news?
2.  What are the effects on
    1.  Individual level?

    2.  Institutional level?

## So what questions should we be asking?

1.  Do we all get exposed to misinformation/fake news?

## Exposure heterogeneity

Different types of people are more/less likely to be exposed to misinformation and fake news

Different types of people are more/less likely to *believe* misinformation and fake news

## Exposure heterogeneity

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-10%20at%2017.31.51.png)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aay3539)

## Exposure heterogeneity

In @allen2020 we see that:

-   Older individuals more likely to consume fake news

-   2% consumed more fake news than mainstream news

    -   But only .7% spent more than 1 min. per day

So is 2% a big number or a small number?

What do we have to consider here?

What do we have to consider here?

1.  The (voting) population of the US
2.  The size of the information ecosystem

## Exposure heterogeneity

Do these trends generalize?

## Exposure heterogeneity

See @guess2019

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-10%20at%2017.40.33.png)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aau4586)

## Exposure heterogeneity

It's not just age...

But also cognitive traits. See @pennycook2019 for more details.

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-10%20at%2018.09.26.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0833-x)

## Exposure heterogeneity

And partisan selective exposure (cf. Week 2) extends to fake news too:

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-10%20at%2018.00.41.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0833-x)

## Exposure heterogeneity

Confirmed by other studies too such as @osmundsen2021

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-10%20at%2019.16.26.png)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/partisan-polarization-is-the-primary-psychological-motivation-behind-political-fake-news-sharing-on-twitter/3F7D2098CD87AE5501F7AD4A7FA83602)

## A summary so far...

So consumption:

1.  Differs by age
2.  Differs by partisan position
3.  Differs by cognitive traits (reflection)

## But what does all this do?

In other words: does consumption of fake news/misinformation have consequences for politics/society/democracy?

One hypothesis:

-   Despite small overall consumption share, misinformation consumption has outsized effects among small subpopulation

## But what does all this do?

Some evidence from @guess2020a

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-10%20at%2019.05.26.png)](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/fake-news-limited-effects-on-political-participation/)

## But what does all this do?

Some evidence from @guess2020a

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-10%20at%2019.06.59.png)](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/fake-news-limited-effects-on-political-participation/)

## But what does all this do?

Though some experimental evidence from @guess2020a suggests effect on voting but not other types of political participation (or trust in media).

## But what does all this do?

Though other work by @bail2019 shows that exposure to misinformation by Internet Research Agency trolls had no effect on important political attitudes and behaviours

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-10%20at%2019.14.45.png)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1906420116)

## In summary

-   Different types of people are exposed to different types of untrustworthy content
-   The size of this consumption is likely small
    -   But what is small after all...?
-   The effects are most obvious for beliefs
    -   More work needed on political behavioural effects

## A note on computational thinking

This week:

-   We see what's measurable (and what isn't) using digital data
    -   e.g., with the @allen2020 article
-   We see how we can extend and validate theoretical models by using digital trace data
    -   e.g., with the article by @vosoughi2018
-   We see how we can combine multiple sources of information to approach an approximate solution to a question
    -   e.g. with the article by @guess2020
