## Introduction

1.  Housekeeping
2.  Polarization and Radicalization

## Introduction: Polarization among voters

## Introduction: Polarization among legislators

## And you'll never guess what's to blame...

## But why?

-   Why would platforms be polarizing?

    -   Echo chambers/filter bubbles?

    -   Moral outrage?

    -   Exposure to out-groups?

## Echo chambers and filter bubbles

1.  Impedes deliberation
2.  Impedes common understanding of out-group opinion

...through reinforcing mechanisms of confirmation bias and information enclaves (think back to Week 2)

## Moral outrage

1.  Humans predisposed to engaging with outrage?

    Evolutionary anthropology shows it helps enforce boundaries

2.  Online platforms biased toward outrage?

    Reinforcement through engagement leads to amplification of outrage

## Moral outrage @brady2021

## Moral outrage

MAD Model by @brady2020

-   *Motivations: "*group-identity-based motivations to share moral-emotional content;"

-   *Attention:* "that such content is especially likely to capture our attention;"

-   *Design:* "the design of social-media platforms amplifies our natural motivational and cognitive tendencies to spread such content"

## Exposure to out-groups @bail2018

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-24%20at%2017.24.50.png)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804840115)

## Exposure to out-groups

Backfire effects result from:

-   Tendency to counter argue with motivated reasoning (see e.g., @taber2006)

    -   Accentuates perceived differences between groups (see e.g., @lord1979)

        -   Reinforces pre-existing beliefs (see e.g., @nyhan2010)

## Exposure to out-groups

[![](images/pnas.1804840115fig01.jpeg)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804840115)

## Exposure to out-groups

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-24%20at%2017.27.07.png)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804840115)

## But can these all be right?

Consider echo chambers and out-group exposure theories...

So what questions should we be asking?

## Some questions

1.  Does Internet age mean we are exposed to *more* or *less* viewpoint diversity?
2.  What type of incongruent information *can* convince?

## ...and back to the algorithm: Radicalization

[![](images/Screenshot%202022-10-24%20at%2017.56.25.png)](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html)

## Radicalization

![](images/Recording%202022-10-24%20at%2017.58.47.gif)

## Radicalization

So why would this make sense?

-   We are attracted toward the lurid, shocking, scandalous

    -   We select into this content

        -   Algorithm feeds us more back

        -   In a reinforcing cycle

## Radicalization

But these kinds of arguments have been made before too...

Think back to high-choice media environments...

## Radicalization

There can be both **supply-side** effects (YouTube algorithm; Cable TV choice etc.)

And also **demand-side** effects (people select into content they were predisposed to like)

## Radicalization @munger2020

## Polarization and Radicalization

Is it as bad as they say it is?

-   Maybe; maybe not.

    -   But there has been notable lack of systematic evidence for some headline-grabbing claims

## Polarization and Radicalization

What can we do better?

-   Get observational data (often proprietary) from companies themselves

-   Consider competing influences (especially for e.g., polarization)

-   Consider non-US contexts

## A note on computational thinking

This week:

1.  Using platform features and APIs to simulate experience (approximation through computation and automation)
2.  Combining traditional experimental and automated digital techniques
